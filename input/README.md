# Input folder

This folder contains input files that can be used with program parameter "-i".

The files generated using parameter "-o" can be directly re-used as input files! So you can edit a set of points in the program, and reuse it later :)

The data files were kindly generated by Pierre Veldeman using some public image found on the internet.
